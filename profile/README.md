# SSO Smith  

**SSO Smith enables effortless SSO integration with Azure, OpenID, and SAML—secure, seamless, and enterprise-ready.**  

## Introduction  

Implementing single sign-on (SSO) can be a daunting task for developers, especially when navigating the complexities of protocols like Azure, OpenID, and SAML. Many developers lack the experience needed to set up secure and reliable SSO connections, and the process often involves extensive testing to get it right. Security is another critical concern—flawed implementations can lead to customer churn or users being locked out. Moreover, SSO setups frequently require collaboration with IT departments, who don’t use the application directly but need their own tools and instructions. SSO Smith addresses all these challenges, making it simple for developers and IT teams to work together, ensuring seamless integration and robust security.
